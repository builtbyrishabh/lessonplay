/**
 * Reference ExperimentLab physics: the "Invisible Particle Detective" bench.
 *
 * Three unknown samples plus a water control are classified as solution,
 * suspension, or colloid using a side light, a stand-and-wait, and a filter.
 * The single hidden property `particleSize` drives every outcome, encoding the
 * deliberate ambiguity that makes it an experiment rather than a quiz:
 *
 *   - `light`  shows a beam for BOTH `fine` (colloid) and `coarse` (suspension),
 *     so light alone cannot separate them — the learner must combine causes.
 *   - `settle` and `filter` only act on `coarse`, isolating the suspension.
 *
 * Observation text is strictly what is *seen*; no inference is given.
